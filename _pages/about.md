I am a research scientist at FAIR, in Meta AI. 
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Intelligent Autonomous Systems lab (IAS)](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) and the [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/).
I received my PhD in Computer Science with summa cum laude from TU Darmstadt under the supervision of [Prof. Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Member/JanPeters).
Previously, I interned as a researcher in [Nvidia's Seattle Robotics Lab (SRL)](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/srl/).
My research have received several awards including several best paper awards and I was finalist for the George Giralt PhD award.
I was honoured to be selected as an R:SS Pioneer in 2023.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **robotics and machine learning**. In particular I explore the combination of fields such as **deep generative models, motion planning and control, imitation learning, optimization, and reinforcement learning.**

If you are interested in similar topics, I am always looking for collaborations or thesis supervision, so please do not hesitate to contact me.
